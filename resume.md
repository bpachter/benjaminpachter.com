## About Me
Hey there! Welcome to my corner of the internet where I get to share tidbits of my journey as a Quantitative Data Scientist. I am currently looking for a new team to channel my energy into, so if you are hiring, thank you for being here! If you have already gone through my resume, you won't find anything new below other than a comprehensive list of technologies I am skilled in. Instead, I would direct you to check out the 'Skillset' page and other pages where I provide deeper insights into my experience and some basic demonstrations!

I’m just a passionate professional who thrives on helping business owners and employees streamline their everyday activities and process flows. Turning raw data into valuable insights is exhilarating to me (when it works)! Whether it’s through sophisticated statistical models, AI algorithms, financial engineering, or distributed systems, I love making sense out of datasets of all kinds.

Using tools like Python, R, C++, JavaScript, Power Query, SAS, and SQL, I reguarly tackle complex challenges head-on to uncover new trends and patterns that significantly influence valuable business decision-making. I integrate cutting-edge AI and machine learning techniques, including deep learning neural networks, to generate predictive insights. Additionally, I leverage distributed systems and blockchain technologies to build scalable, secure, and efficient solutions that redefine operational efficiency.

My expertise spans advanced financial engineering, using models like Black-Scholes for options pricing and Monte Carlo simulations for risk assessment. I also employ AI-driven algorithms for asset selection, credit scoring, and customer segmentation. By combining my knowledge of Apache Kafka, Spark, Hadoop, and other distributed technologies, I ensure real-time data processing and analytics.

Ultimately, my purpose is to harness the power of data and frontline technologies to drive innovation and operational efficiency, creating stress-free, insightful experiences for business owners and employees alike.

## Personal Life
Outside of my professional life, I dedicate my time to researching complex options trading strategies, focusing on automating brokerage APIs with machine learning concepts. I actively contribute to online forums like Discord, where I teach retail traders how to apply risk management and discipline to achieve financial independence through options and futures strategies. I also thoroughly enjoy reading whenever I get the chance. The subjects I am most interested in are current and historical economics/geopolitics, code developing, business & trading psychology, and evolutionary biology. When I'm not immersed in these activities, I enjoy spending time with my loving fiancé and our three cats in our cozy apartment. I also love mountain overlanding, hiking, exploring new local hangout spots -  anything that feels like an adventure!

Thank you for being here, and remember,
