## Personal Life
Outside of my professional life, I dedicate my time to researching complex options trading strategies, focusing on automating brokerage APIs with machine learning concepts. I actively contribute to online forums like Discord, where I teach retail traders how to apply risk management and discipline to achieve financial independence through options and futures strategies. I also thoroughly enjoy reading whenever I get the chance. The subjects I am most interested in are current and historical economics/geopolitics, code developing, business & trading psychology, and evolutionary biology. When I'm not immersed in these activities, I enjoy spending time with my loving fiancé and our three cats in our cozy apartment. I also love mountain overlanding, hiking, exploring new local hangout spots - generally anything that feels like an adventure!
