## My Purpose
Hey there! Welcome to my corner of the internet where I get to share tidbits of my journey thus far as a Quantitative Data Scientist. I am currently looking for a new team to divert my energy to, so if you are hiring, thank you for being here! If you happen to already have gone through my Resume word document, then you won't find anything new below other than mu comprehensive list of technologies I am skilled in. I would instead direct you to check out The 'Skillset' page and some of the other pages where I have provided deeper insights to my experience, as well as some basic demonstrations! 

I’m really just a dude who is passionate about helping business owners and employees alike operate their everyday activities and process-flows in a stressfree manner. Turning raw data into valuable insights is just fun to me! Whether it’s through sophisticated statistical models that make me feel smarter than I am, deep learning neural networks for prediction generation, or just plain old number crunching, I thrive on the challenge of making sense out of datasets of all kinds! Primarily using tools like Python, R, C++, Javascript, Power Query, and SQL, it has become my passion to tackle complex challenges head-on to uncover new trends and patterns that may significantly influence valuable business decision making.

## Personal Life
Outside of my professional life, I dedicate my time to researching complex options trading strategies, focusing on automating brokerage APIs with machine learning concepts. I actively contribute to online forums like Discord, where I teach retail traders how to apply risk management and discipline to achieve financial independence through options and futures strategies. I also thoroughly enjoy reading whenever I get the chance. The subjects I am most interested in are current and historical economics/geopolitics, code developing, business & trading psychology, and evolutionary biology. When I'm not immersed in these activities, I enjoy spending time with my loving fiancé and our three cats in our cozy apartment. I also love mountain overlanding, hiking, exploring new local hangout spots -  anything that feels like an adventure!

Thank you for being here, and remember,
