## Financial Modeling, Data Transformation, and Dashboard Development
I develop comprehensive financial and logistical models using **Python**, **SQL**, and **Power Query** to extract, transform, and load versatile data structures to tell compelling stories. The neutrality of raw data has always fascinated me, and when harnessed and channeled correctly, unbiased numbers can be translated into unbiased results that drive clear and confident decision-making.

Initializing business and economic narratives through data transformations and coding has become my hobby these days; I am personally motivated to consistently increase my tech capabilities through my own trading and investing decision optimization. Plus, it is clear that the future is filled with robots; leveraging code is the single most important tool we have available to drive into this reality!

```The robot revolution has already arrived - we just keep them in data centers and servers. - Naval Ravikant```

I've mastered traditional reporting and interactive modeling through **Excel** and **Power BI**, though I have been involved in many other technologies. Automation is the name of the game these days, and I don't spend as much time on the front-end of Excel as I used to. I'd rather transform the data in cloud servers and code the steps in a more efficient and centralized ETL structure before the data even gets to Excel. However, I still love to work in Excel models whenever necessary!

In past experiences, I have developed and supported:

- **Underwriting models** for sizing up multifamily investment properties and other CRE asset types,
- **Portfolio models** for property, bond, and equity holdings evaluations,
- **Monte Carlo models** for predicting interest rate risk for securitized portfolios, carry trades, short-volatility trades, etc.,
- **Black-Scholes pricing models** for determining the fair value of options portfolios and optimizing risk management,
- and **Logistics models** that transform raw data into identifiable patterns that promote decision-making.

These days I am most interested in studying complex options trading strategies and automating these through brokerage APIs. My favorite is IBKR, as it is easy to set up a paper trading account that can be directly connected to my TradingView Pine scripts for easy and transparent backtesting.

## Database and Cloud Server Management
In previous roles, I have managed database and cloud infrastructure, utilizing the following technologies:
- **SQL Server Management Studio** for testing and deploying new stored procedures and tables,
- **Salesforce Development (SOQL, Apex, and Flow Automations)** to ensure seamless business process optimization in CRM sites,
- and the big three **Azure**, **Google Cloud**, and **AWS**, which have allowed me to implement robust cloud solutions for scalable and secure data storage.
-  I am also capable within **Tableau**, **QlikView**, **SAS**, **Hubspot**, **Dynamics**, and **Oracle**.

## Machine Learning and Data Science
This is where I find myself most of the time these days, as the implications for mastering such technologies are beyond profound. My expertise in this field spans several key areas, including predictive modeling, data manipulation, statistical analysis, and data visualization, which are all integral to drawing actionable insights from complex datasets.

I have developed and implemented a variety of predictive models using **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**, and **Keras**. These frameworks have enabled me to build deep learning models for tasks such as time series forecasting, image recognition, and natural language processing. For instance, I have used **TensorFlow** to construct neural networks that predict financial market movements and **PyTorch** to create convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification problems.

Recently, I decided to make my ML experience concrete and more robust with the online certifications provided by Deeplearning.AI and Stanford University. These courses provided solid foundations in concepts that I had already been mostly familiar with since my days at BMW Manufacturing. Some of my favorite algorithms are tree ensembles, logistic regression, feature scaling, gradient boosting, and - of course - artificial neural networks!

Most of the time, I am using the simple-to-use **Scikit-learn**, where building and evaluating ML models such as regression, decision trees, and support vector machines (SVMs) is easy and transparent. In the past, I have applied these models to multifamily rent prediction and cash flow performance models, as well as client credit scoring, customer segmentation, and portfolio risk assessment. I have applied these concepts with Yardi Matrix, Equifax, Bloomberg, and various e-commerce data structures.

More recently, I have been experimenting with shaping Federal Reserve macroeconomic data (FRED) for monitoring the economic health of the global economy. Particularly, I have employed the FRED, FDIC, and Census APIs to easily shape together unraveling macro and micro trends.

My approach to machine learning and quantitative data science utilizes a combination of these technical skills and a strategic understanding of business needs. This ensures that the solutions I develop are technically sound and crystal clear in transparency, ensuring client needs are not just met but exceeded. Whether the problem is optimizing investment strategies, enabling proactive risk management, or uncovering new micro-investment opportunities, I am committed to leveraging the most advanced data science techniques available (that my 4090 Nvidia processor can manage, that is!) to drive impactful business decision making.

## Web Development and Automation
I have contributed to various web development projects utilizing frameworks such as **Django**, **Flask**, and **FastAPI**, where I worked on teams focused on integrating complex data workflows while ensuring secure data architecture transitions. My proficiency in **JavaScript** also proved invaluable here, complemented by familiarity with **HTML**/**CSS**, useful for embedding files and images into webpages.

At NYMT, I frequently operated within **Salesforce**, both front-end and back-end, to support a highly customized business environment. This involved enabling deal leads through the creation of dynamic and user-friendly interfaces where the entire business operated. I combined **Power BI** and **Salesforce** layouts to create immersive and highly customizable web dashboards for stakeholders. Backend services such as **Salesforce Apex** and **Flow Automations** supported the underlying multifamily investing business where highly specialized automated processes were necessary.

Additionally, I have utilized **Go** and **Scala** for their high performance and scalability. Automation scripts written in **Bash** and **PowerShell** have streamlined repetitive tasks, and I have engaged in multicore processing projects to maximize data-churning efficiency for clients. My experience extends to **Swift** for mobile iOS development and **C#** and **Rust** for more niche development projects in the past.

In various projects, I have also leveraged **Apache Kafka** for real-time data streaming, **Apache Hadoop** for large-scale data processing and storage, and **Apache Spark** for distributed data processing. These technologies have enabled me to manage and analyze large datasets efficiently, ensuring data integrity and rapid processing times.

## Investment Deal Making and Portfolio Management
Though deal negotiation has not been my primary function, I have modeled and underwritten multifamily lending deals that rely on **Excel**, **Power Query**, **VBA**, **Python**, and **SQL**. It was important to understand complex credit concepts necessary for getting the numbers to line up to investment standards. A robust understanding of the capital stack structure was required for making business data decisions; over time I learned to analyze specific lending deals where specialized knowledge in underwriting CRE assets for preferred equity, mezzanine, JV, and senior lending was crucial for success.
